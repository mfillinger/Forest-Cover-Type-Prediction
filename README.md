# Forest Cover Type Prediction

This project was completed by Michael Fillinger for CSI 5810 at Oakland University.

The goal of this project is to predict the type of forest cover in the Roosevelt National Forest (Colorado) using cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, aspect, and soil type.  
The dataset used comes from the *Kaggle Forest Cover Type Prediction* challenge.


## How to Run

1. Make sure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `train_forest_cover.py`
   - `app.py`
   - `best_forest_model.pkl`
   - `train.csv`

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
